                    This song is about the industry and how it is capable
                    of doing anything just to get to money. This song has the same
                    message as the "Welcome to the machine" album.</p>

                    Ironically, they are talking about how they
                    can make you rich and how you're going to
                    be loved.

                    They are worshiping the band and tell them how
                    they are 'just fantastic' yet they can't seem to
                    remember their name.

                    They keep pointing out 
                    the fact that these companies will go as long 
                    as possible to squeeze every last cent out of their clients. <br>

                    This song came out after the "The dark side 
                    of the moon" album which was sold out. After that album, the company
                    realised how much money they can make from this band
                    So, they wanted to keep them and exploit them as much as possible.

                    The company is telling them how they can be even
                    bigger just if they stick with them and 
                    'all pull together as a team'
