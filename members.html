                    was a founder member, keyboardist, and vocalist of the band.
                      Rick was kicked out of the band by Roger while they were 
                      recording album “The Wall” in 1979. He was an integral member, 
                      though his creative input lessened over 
                    the years as Roger increasingly assumed control of the band.

                    erratic behaviour that made him too difficult to deal with.

                <p>
                    Bob Klose, was , between 1964 and July 1965, 
                    he lead guitarist of an early rock band that later 
                    became Pink Floyd. It is said that Syd Barret was the 
                    lead guitarist of the band, but Bob Klose was originally 
                    the first one that had become that. Members have said that 
                    his departure helped them to get away from blues and 
                    R&B, and make a way for something more original.
